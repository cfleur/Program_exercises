4.a. yes files have inodes. df -i ot ls -i
	Inode is short for index node. It is a representation of a file system object (i.e. file / directory).
4.b. 1222896053 or 96% are free. df --total -i 
4.c. By deleting files and directories. 
	Inodes mark a place that a file is, so that file needs to be deleted with all possible links to it in mind.
	I think there are many ways to do this, some more effectiv than others. 
	One way -> use mke2fs -N when creating a file system, -N tag is a manual override to the default claculation of number of inodes that should be reserved for file system.
	However, since there are already inodes accociated with your existing files / dirs, you could simply rename unwanted objects, as opposed to deleting and creating new ones, thus not creating the need to use anymore inodes.
